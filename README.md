quick-start
===========

requirements:
-------------

 * CUDA
 * cmake 2.8+
 * openGL
 * pthreads

build:
------
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make -j4

  Cmake is a meta-build system that will build makefiles for your system
  all autogenerated files can be built in a separate build directory.
  If you want to start fresh, you can remove the build directory entirely as
  there is no source or version control files in that folder

  binary executables are in build/intro/ and build/advanced
